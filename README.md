# ASP.NET Library API
A RESTful ASP.NET Web API for managing users, authors, books, and comments in a digital library system.

## Key Features

- Response caching with Redis  
- API versioning  
- JWT authentication with refresh token  
- Role-based authorization (Admin/User roles)  
- Azure Blob Storage for file uploads  
- Rate limiting to control traffic  
- SQL database with EF Core

## Live Demo
Since it's hosted on a free plan, the API might take a few seconds to start if it's been idle â€” and sometimes it might be down temporarily.
